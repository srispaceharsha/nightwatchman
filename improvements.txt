Claude, I need to be able to do this: 1. Have this monitoring application and home assistant automation container run on a raspberry p1 5 (8GB ram) with a NoIR camera connected. 

So that the alerts can be sent to my iPhone (notify with sounds) via the home assistant framework / automation.

Now, 

Context

1. Home Assistant is already running on a Raspberry Pi on my LAN (92.168.1.4:8123)

2. The Home Assistant iOS app is installed and connected to this instance.

3. I want this monitoring app (the running on the same Pi) to send alerts to Home Assistant via a webhook, and then have Home Assistant forward those as push notifications to my iPhone.

Identify the ncessary tasks and list please?
